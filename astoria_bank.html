SUMMER READING at QUEENS LIBRARY: FUNDING REQUEST
THE NEED
Children Lose Reading Ability During the Summer: Research demonstrates that children who do not read during the summer lose some of their reading ability—suffering an achievement gap of up to three months below those who do read. This gap, referred to as the “summer slide,” accumulates during the elementary school years so that by the end of the 6th grade, the difference between summer readers and non-readers may be as great as 18 months. Because low-income and immigrant children tend to have less parental support for literacy, they are more likely to suffer from this gap. 
High Literacy Needs of Immigrant Children: Queens Library serves the 2.3 million residents of Queens—the nation’s most ethnically diverse county, where 160 languages are spoken by residents from 191 countries/territories.   Queens also has the highest number of English Language Learners of all the five Boroughs: more than 45,000 (NY City Department of Education, Office of English Language Learners, 2010-11). Often, the children served by the library have reading comprehension below grade level and possess weak oral language skills—including listening and speaking—both essential components to literacy. According to CCCNY more than 17% of Queens children ages 0-13 live in linguistically isolated households. Many immigrant children have parents who are not familiar with the formal school system in America. Due to language barriers, they are often reticent to assist their children with homework, unaware of their critical role in supporting literacy and school activities at home. As a result, these students are far less likely to read at home during the critical summer months.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Summer Reading
For over fifty years, Queens Library's free Summer Reading Program has helped young people maintain or improve their reading skills during critical summer months. This tremendously popular program encourages youth to read for enjoyment, and provides books  based on children’s interests rather than the prescriptive reading lists traditionally offered in reading programs. Many families and students are introduced to the Library through Summer Reading and subsequently take advantage of its resources throughout the year.
Combating the summer slide, Queens Library’s Summer Family Reading Program 2014, with the theme “Fizz BOOM Read,” offered 5,804  programs with recorded attendance of 138,509. These programs brought children and teens to the Library where they were entertained and encouraged to come back often to learn and explore. Programs ranged from Mandarin for Beginners, to Arts & Craft workshops, to Yoga and Zumba classes, to Chess and Table Tennis Clubs to Book Buddies reading teams and Vocabulary Word Contests, to Fun with Science workshops and many more. We offered Summer Reading Programs across Queens County in 59 libraries (three of our libraries were closed for renovation). In 2014, 62,827 unique children and teen borrowers took home 1,189,580 books—an average of 18 books per child.  That doesn’t include all the books read by children while they were in the Library, or the books borrowed on their parent’s library cards.
Additionally, Queens Library offered a Family Summer Reading Program in several Queens County shelters including Saratoga Family Inn, Hillside House and 93rd Family Residency. Collections were created for the three locations and included books for all ages and reading levels. The parents and children were very excited about borrowing books. The majority of books in the shelter collections circulated,  with parents and children continually returning for new books.  

Summer Reading 2015,  with the theme of "Every Hero Has a Story," will encourage children to explore themes related to superheroes and everyday heroes. Summer Reading at Queens Library provides youngsters with constructive activities that complement their reading activities and encourage them to frequent the Library. Incentives and prizes presented for enrollment and reading achievements help motivate participants. The 2015 Queens Library Summer Reading Program will provide a wide range of resources and incentives to program participants that include  summer reading booklists, reading logs, take-home arts and crafts projects, certificates of accomplishment, prizes such as stickers, pencils, flashlights, library card holders, small toys,  as well as lunches and snacks. , 
Queens Library’s extraordinary participation levels are due to a dedicated staff that develops unique activities to excite children about reading. Librarians will conduct more than 3,000 Summer Reading activities and programs during 2015 including:    
•	Queens Library will continue Reading Eggs, at 20 community libraries. This Web based program is designed to build reading and comprehension skills for pre-school children and students up to grade seven through interactive comprehension lessons, motivational games, and a range of fiction and non-fiction e-books. Reading Eggs tracks and measures each child's progress in improving their reading and comprehension skills.
