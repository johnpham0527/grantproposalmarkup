Project Information
Project Name
Please provide the name of your American Dream project: Serving Queens County’ Adult English Language Learners at Woodside and Woodhaven
Adult Literacy Need
Indicate the need for adult literacy services for English language learners at your library and in your community, per the following information. Using the most recent U.S. Census and other data, describe the demographics of the community served by the library.
-	Which geographical area does your library serve? Queens Borough Public Library (QBPL) serves Queens County in New York State at 65 locations.
-	What is the area’s unemployment rate? 4.9%
-	What is the median household income in the area? $57,241
-	What percentage of the population lives below the poverty line? 15.2%
-	What are the estimated literacy rates in the community? 46% lack basic prose literacy skills, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics in 2003. 10.5% possess less than a 9th grade education. 29.7% speaks English less than very well.
-	What is the community high school graduation rate, and if available, the dropout rate? The graduation rate is 68.9% for all class cohorts from 2001 through 2011. The dropout rate is 14.7% for all class cohorts during the same period.
Data Collection and Community Engagement
How have data collection and community engagement helped you determine the needs of the adult English language learner population you serve? Please be as specific as possible. (250 words maximum)

Queens Library gathers a variety of information and constantly engages with the communities of Queens to understand the needs of Queens County’s adult English language learner population. The Library has a staff demographer who analyzes census and American Community Survey data to guide international language collection development, program development and marketing. In addition, as part of the development of its strategic plan in 2013, Queens Library conducted a number of library customer focus groups. Focus groups conducted with a high concentration of new Americans indicated a desire among adult English language learners for programs and workshops on topics such as legal rights, child development, giving children a good education and entrepreneurship. This information, in turn, compelled the Library to pursue and win a state grant to open an “Opportunity Center” that provides free legal assistance for citizenship applications, as well as free community workshops for immigrants on children’s education and entrepreneurship. Moreover, the Library’s New Americans Program, which hosts hundreds of programs each year on topics relevant to adult English language learners, collects survey data at the end of each workshop that helps staff discern the most popular workshop titles, beneficial topics, and well-rated external presenters.

Project Description
Describe in detail your proposed project for adult English language learners, including the following information in your narrative. (500 words maximum)
-	What is the project design?
-	Are the services new or an expansion of existing services?
-	Whom will you be serving? Is this/are these population(s) new to your community
-	How will these literacy services for adult English language learners benefit the library and the community?
-	Will your project include bookmobile-based literacy services for adult English language learners? If so, please describe your current bookmobile literacy services and how the proposed project will augment those services.

Queens Library serves Queens County, one of the most diverse counties in the nation, at its 65 locations. The Library’s English Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Program operates 34 classes per year at 19 community library sites. The Library also offers volunteer-led informal English conversation groups at 13 sites.
The Library proposes to strengthen its existing ESOL classes at Woodhaven and Woodside by purchasing Common Core State Standards-aligned textbooks and laptops for technology instruction. Each site offers 30 “seats” each semester—potentially enabling as many as 120 English language learners in total at both sites over the course of two semesters during the year to benefit from Common Core-aligned textbooks and computer training. The Library also proposes to implement informal English conversation groups to serve both ESOL program participants and non-participants at these two sites, which currently do not have any groups. Queens Library would target the Spanish-speaking residents, who comprise 40% of Woodhaven’s and 28% of Woodside’s foreign-born populations. The Library would also target Chinese and Bengali-speaking residents, who together comprise a 17% of the foreign-born population in Woodhaven and 20% of the foreign-born population in Woodside. Over two-thirds (35%) of Woodhaven’s foreign-born population arrived in the United States after 2000, and 6% arrived after 2010. Nearly half (44%) of Woodside’s foreign-born residents arrived in the U.S. after 2000, and 8% arrived after 2010.
Queens Library has already aligned its ESOL curriculum to Common Core. However, the Library currently carries Common Core-aligned textbooks for six ESOL program sites only. Grant funds would enable the Library to purchase volumes one through three of the “Ventures” textbook series for use in the ESOL classes at Woodhaven and Woodside.
Employment is integral to the Library’s literacy approach, and digital literacy is essential for employment. Grant funds would enable the Library to purchase laptops to provide technology instruction as part of the ESOL class curriculum at Woodhaven and Woodside. Library staff would also use these laptops to assist with pre- and post-testing of ESOL program participants.
Because of limited resources, Queens Library is unable to implement ESOL classes at all library branches. Additionally, the Library’s ESOL classes have a large waiting list at some branches that serve a large population of new Americans. In response, Queens Library has strategically deployed volunteer-led, informal English conversation groups to alleviate some of the demand for formal ESOL classes that use paid teachers. These conversation groups are open to both ESOL program participants looking for supplementary language practice outside of the classroom and to adult English language learners who are unable to participate or enroll in a formal ESOL class. The libraries at Woodhaven and Woodside currently do not have conversation groups. As an in-kind contribution to the project, Queens Library would recruit, train and place volunteers to lead a conversation group at Woodhaven and Woodside.
The project will not include bookmobile literacy services.


Capacity
Detail how your library has the capacity to implement this project, including: (250 words maximum)
-	How will you staff this initiative? (include library staff and any contract or partner organizations staff)
-	What in-kind support will the library provide, such as meeting space, printing and distribution, collections development, IT support, matching funds, etc.?

Queens Library would engage two paid ESOL teachers for the initiative. One teacher would be assigned to Woodhaven Community Library and the other to Woodside Community Library. Each teacher would conduct two classes during the year and would administer pre- and post- BEST Plus tests for students. They would work six hours a week over 24 weeks. Marco Castillo, the Library’s ESOL Coordinator responsible for the supervision and operations of the ESOL Program, would supervise and train the teachers. Mr. Castillo has over 15 years of experience in ESOL and adult literacy, including seven years in a program coordinator capacity. He currently supervises two full-time staff members, three part-time data assistants, and 25 part-time teachers.
The Adult Education Volunteer Advisor from the Volunteer Services Unit will recruit community volunteers to lead the new English conversation groups at Woodhaven and Woodside. The Volunteer Advisor would conduct recruitment through the Library’s online volunteer website and through word of mouth across the Library’s seven Adult Learning Centers. Once the volunteers are recruited, Mr. Castillo Marco would train them and deploy them at Woodhaven and Woodside. Conversation groups would take place on a weekly basis at program rooms available at the Woodhaven and Woodside library sites.
HANAC, a community-based partner organization, will support the initiative by providing citizenship and legal services for program participants. The cost of these services is valued at $1,000.
CIANA, another community-based partner organization, will support the initiative by providing “Pathways to U.S. Citizenship” workshops for program participants interested in the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. CIANA will also provide referrals to free and low-cost immigration attorneys. The cost of these services is valued at $2,000.

Outreach and Collaboration
Indicate your plans for working with partners, if applicable, and the community at large to facilitate and promote the project. (250 words maximum)
-	Provide a list of your community partners, if applicable, and indicate what, specifically, each of the partners will contribute to the project.
-	How will volunteers contribute to this initiative?
-	How will you publicize and promote this project within the library and to the community at large?
HANAC, a partner organization, will provide in-kind citizenship and legal services for program participants referred from Queens Library who need to consult with an attorney regarding their immigration status and other legal needs. 
CIANA, another partner organization, will provide in-kind “Pathways to U.S. Citizenship” workshops and referrals to immigration attorneys for program participants interested in applying for U.S. citizenship.
Queens Library will recruit two volunteers who will each lead a weekly English language conversation group at the Woodside and Woodhaven Community Libraries.  These volunteers will be recognized for their service, along with other volunteers in the ESOL program, on an annual basis.
Queens Library would publicize and promote this project by distributing print materials in English, Spanish and Chinese throughout Woodside and Woodhaven in the local library sites, churches, parent associations, stores and businesses, banks and afterschool programs. Moreover, the Library would post notices on social media sites and issue press releases to ethnic press and radio.

Evaluation and Sustainability
Detail how you will evaluate and sustain the initiative, including the following information: (250 words maximum)
-	Which outcomes will you use to measure the project's impact? These might include, for example, the number of students who progress to the next ESL level, the number of GED graduates, or participants' change in employment status.
-	How will you measure the outcomes? This could include data collection methods already in place, such as circulation data, as well as tools you design, such as a survey.
-	How will you ensure sustainability of the literacy services when the grant ends?

Queens Library will measure the impact of the students receiving the Common Core textbooks by conducting pre- and post-tests using the BEST Plus assessment to gauge their education gain. Queens Library’s standard educational gain target is for at least 51% of students to attain at least one National Reporting System (NRS) level or higher. The Library will measure the impact of laptops on student learning by conducting a pre- and post-survey. Queens Library will measure the impact of the new English conversation groups by measuring attendance levels and by conducting participant satisfaction surveys.
Queens Library would seek operating funds from the City of New York to pay for ESOL teachers, ESOL program management, and volunteer recruitment and management. Additional City funds may also enable the Library to establish new structured ESOL classes at library sites where English conversation groups are well-attended.
