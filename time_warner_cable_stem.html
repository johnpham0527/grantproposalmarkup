                        <h2>Organization Mission and Vision</h2>
                            <h3 id="mission">Mission Statement</h3>
                            <p>The Queens Library Foundation is the fundraising arm of Queens Borough Public Library (also known as “Queens Library”).  Incorporated in 1988, the mission of the Queens Library Foundation is to raise funds to support the tens of thousands of free programs and services offered by Queens Library.  The mission of Queens Library is to provide quality services, resources, and lifelong learning opportunities through books and a variety of other formats to meet the informational, educational, cultural, and recreational needs and interests of its diverse and changing population.</p>
                            <h3>Organization's Key Areas of Focus</h3>
                                <p>Best Out Of School Time (BOOST) aims to enhance the academic and social skills of children ages 6 to 14 by providing homework assistance and materials in an enriching after-school environment. Each Library also provides an assortment of fun and educational activities for children and teens. With BOOST, young people know that they can find educational help and print and online resources, and enjoy fun activities at their local libraries. The program serves nearly 2,000 children daily and is available at 63 local community libraries from 3:00-6:00PM weekdays.</p>
                                <p>The Adult Learner Program provides free, quality services, resources and lifelong learning opportunities to the borough's growing non-English speaking population and for those born in America who struggle to read and write English. The program specializes in serving "low-level English-language learners," those who begin with little to no English understanding and are often left out of other adult learner programs.</p>
                                <p>Offered at libraries across Queens, the New Americans Program bring thousands of people to the Library each year to learn more about how to acclimate to life in America and to enjoy art, music, culture and history that are reflective of the diversity of our borough. Educational programs are offered in different languages on a wide range of topics--from citizenship, computer classes and parenting workshops to health and exercise programs, financial literacy and housing information. Cultural programs help Library users of all ages to celebrate their own histories and discover more about the traditions of their neighbors.</p>
                                <p>Queens Library’s Mail-A-Book Service allows homebound customers to borrow library materials, including regular and large-print books, audio books, DVDs and CDs without leaving their homes, nursing homes, or assisted living facilities. Mail-a-Book also offers homebound customers a unique opportunity to socialize remotely, through weekly telephone chats, book discussions special events, Bingo, and Trivial Pursuit. Additionally, the Library offers Rotating Collections to area nursing homes, along with specialized programming. Through these activities, the Library expands its services and learning opportunities for those who are unable to visit our branches.</p>

                        <h2>Program Description</h2>
                            <h3>Community Needs Assessment</h3>
                                <p>Queens Library serves Flushing, a diverse community with 70% of residents born outside of the United States. The neighborhood is pre-dominantly Chinese (54%) and is home to a large number of Koreans (10%), and East Indians (6%). Over 2,800 youth ages 10-14 live in Flushing. Only 42% of residents over age five are English proficient. </p>
                                <p>The city recently reported that language barriers significantly contribute to Queens’ rising poverty. Many low-income Queens residents are immigrants whose limited English proficiency prevents them from accessing social benefits, working, or earning higher wages. Language barriers also contribute to poor student performance.  The state’s graduation rates for English learners have declined since 2011 as other students’ rates have increased.</p>
                                <p>Language barriers combined with adolescent risk factors place Flushing’s middle school youth at risk of academic failure. During the 2012-2013 school year, only 38.8% read at grade level and just 52.2% passed the standardized math exam. Middle school youth either stay on track to pursue higher education and career aspirations or become increasingly disconnected.  They can become disconnected when they struggle to navigate physical, mental, and emotional changes. They may also struggle with changing relationships in school, at home, among friends, and in the community.  </p>
                                <p>Child development experts Shields and Behrman (2004) have identified key transitions for adolescents from immigrant families: “finishing school, acquiring work skills, postponing parenthood, and being physically and mentally healthy.”  These researchers further assert that for these youth, “acquiring strong skills in math, science, and technology will be increasingly important to securing well-paying jobs in the future.” Out-of-school time (OST) programs can help youth navigate such transitions during the critical middle school years. It is paramount for Flushing’s diverse middle youth to be steered towards OST opportunities that support their positive development and build their skills in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).</p>
                                <p>Flushing’s middle school students face barriers to participating in OST programs. 78.6% qualify for free or reduced lunch. The poverty rate among Flushing households with children ages 5 to 17 is 25.6%. These data indicate middle school families’ inability to pay for OST programs. According to Flushing’s Community District, the city’s two free Beacon OST sites cannot sufficiently serve all middle school youth.</p>
                                <p>Youth need reinforcement from their parents to more effectively grasp STEM concepts taught in the classroom. National Institute of Health’s research indicates that parents become less effectively involved in their children’s education beginning in middle school.  Over one in four Flushing residents over age 25 do not possess a high school diploma, indicating that many parents may feel unable to adequately assist their middle school children with homework.</p>
                            <h3>Queens Library’s Background</h3>
                                <p>Queens Library currently engages over 4,000 elementary school students and 1,000 parents annually in STEM through the Discovery Team program operated at the Children’s Library Discovery Center (CLDC). Opened in 2011, the CLDC is a new concept in children’s libraries that combines the excitement of an interactive museum with the vast resources of a public library, housed within a 22,000 square foot building. The CLDC offers hands-on, participatory exhibits created by the San Francisco Exploratorium and funded by the National Science Foundation. The Discovery Team program employs part-time, trained staff who work within the CLDC to interpret interactive exhibits on STEM topics and implement enriching, hands-on activities that build on the exhibit experience. They also serve as educational mentors, planning and facilitating weekly science activities which lead up to the Saturday Science Labs for elementary aged children and their caregivers.</p>
                                <p>Queens Library has also previously partnered with Con Edison and National Grid to present STEM programs for K-12 students. Con Edison conducted “Science Fair How-To” sessions for children to explore ideas for science fair projects and organize their projects using the scientific method. National Grid created an “Energy Fair,” a traveling exhibit which educated elementary and middle school students on alternative energy sources.</p>
                            <h3>Program Components</h3>
                                <p>Queens Library requests $19,881.64 to operate an OST STEM program at the Flushing Community Library. The program will engage Flushing’s middle school youth in STEM through exciting, hands-on inquiry based learning. The Library will also invite caregivers to participate alongside their children in selected activities to assist them in understanding the different elements of STEM and to support them as they help their children learn.</p>
                                <p>The Library will implement a STEM curriculum based on the CLDC’s successful Discovery Team and Saturday Science Labs programs. The program at Flushing Community Library will focus on addressing the development and academic needs of middle school youth. The curriculum will excite and engage middle school children through an array of age-appropriate, inquiry-based STEM programs in graphic design, robotics, animation, architecture, and video game design. Youth will complete projects in each of these program areas.</p>
                                <p>Queens Library will retain the parent participation component of the Discovery Team and Saturday Science Labs programs at the CLDC. Caregivers of participating youth will be invited to “Homework Help Diner.” At these monthly sessions, the Library will provide snacks while caregivers and their students collaborate on selected STEM activities such as 3-D model programming and science contests.</p>
                                <p>Flushing Community Library will operate the program two days per week for 20 sessions per year. The program will begin on 9/1/2014 and will end on 6/30/2015. The program will serve 900 children and parents per year. Flushing Community Library will host three Middle School STEM Showcases during the fall, winter, and early spring. These showcases will provide a space for youth to highlight completed projects to date to their peers and the community. Flushing Community Library will also organize a Family Science Fair, the culminating event for youth to showcase final projects and for staff to recognize the participants’ accomplishments.</p>
                                <p>Time Warner Cable will be highlighted as the sponsor of all three Middle School STEM Showcases and the culminating Family Science Fair. At each showcase or fair, approximately three to four Time Warner Cable employees will conduct a special guest presentation related to the showcase’s theme, such as robotics, graphic design, or animations. Queens Library will provide Time Warner Cable floor space for an exhibition or booth at each of these events.</p>
                                <p>Queens Library will hire and train a Discovery Team member to facilitate the curriculum at Flushing Community Library. The Library will also partner with CUNY to hire science and math interns who will help the member create and implement programs.</p>
                            <h3>Program Outreach</h3>
                                <p>Queens Library will encourage middle school youth and their parents who are currently being served by Flushing Community Library to participate. The Library will display posters in Flushing Community Library. Library staff will outreach to local schools and community-based organizations. Staff will distribute flyers throughout Queens Library’s “Enrich Your Life” magazine and Queens Library’s monthly program guide.</p>

                        <h2>Program Outcomes</h2>
                            <p>The program will increase middle school youths’ exploration of STEM concepts. They will express a stronger interest in exploring activities and links to math, science, engineering, and technology. Youth will also become more aware of STEM fields of study and career paths. The Library will conduct pre- and post-surveys of students and parents to measure the participants’ STEM knowledge attained and their level of interest and engagement with STEM.  The Library will also collect participants’ daily attendance data.</p>

                    <section id="budget">
                        <h2>Program Budget</h2>
                            <p>A Discovery Team member will facilitate enriching, hands-on inquiry-based science learning activities for children and their families. The member will work 17 hours per week for 36 weeks at $11.00 per hour. The children’s librarian will supervise the Discovery Team member. The member will cost $6,732, plus $649.64 in fringe benefits calculated at the rate of 9.65%.</p>
                            <p>Consumable STEM supplies, as well as STEM books and resources, are necessary for the Discovery Team member to facilitate enriching, hands-on learning activities. The activities will invite children to generate their own representations of information and experiences ranging from low-tech drawings to high-tech graphic design, animations, robotics, architectural renderings, and video games. Queens Library requests funds $7,000 for STEM supplies and materials.</p>
                            <p>A 3-D printer would open a world of possibilities in creating objects, understanding technology in new ways and learning about various STEM principles. Programming would be more robust and could include such topics as “maker” projects, entrepreneurial learning and technological innovation. Queens Library requests $3,500 to purchase a 3-D printer.</p>
                            <p>The Library allocates a 10% overhead cost rate towards each budget to cover the cost of grants management, fiscal management, and participant recruitment.  Administrative costs total $2,000.</p>
                                <p>In-kind costs include computers, laptops, CUNY interns, full-time administrative and library staff, marketing, space and supplies.</p>
